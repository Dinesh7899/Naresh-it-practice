<!-- objects are collections of key-value pairs. sometimes,you might need to know how many keys an object contains. To achieve this, we can use the `Object.key()`method. this method taes an object as its argument and returns an array containing the keys of that object.

Once we have this array of keys, we can simply find its length to determine the total count of keys in th object.This gives us a quick and effective way to get this information without manually counting each key. -->
